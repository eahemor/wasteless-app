# WasteLess App
Gamified Sustainability Education Platform for International Students
University of Greenwich - MSc Project Development Dissertation
Project Overview
WasteLess is a Progressive Web Application designed to help international students at the University of Greenwich navigate UK waste disposal systems through gamification and cultural adaptation. The application addresses the challenge of cultural differences in waste management practices by providing an engaging, educational platform.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Learning Games**: Drag-and-drop waste sorting challenges with real-time feedback
- **Cultural Adaptation**: Comparison tools highlighting differences between UK and international waste practices
- **Gamification Elements**: Comprehensive badge system, leaderboards, and progress tracking
- **International Student Focus**: Multi-country support with tailored content for diverse backgrounds
- **Progressive Web App**: Cross-device compatibility and offline functionality

## Research Impact
Based on user testing with 28 participants from 18 countries:
- 32/10 average usability rating
- 89% daily challenge completion rate
- 34% increase in user engagement
- 75% improvement in recycling rate awareness
- 100% cultural adaptation success rate
